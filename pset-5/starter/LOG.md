# Discussion
It took me a bit of time to understand how to translate my conceptual understanding of AVL trees to coding them, specifically in the balance and rotation functions. I was able to get close, but there was often one line of my implementation that was incorrect and causing errors, which I found difficult to find. I do feel that I now have a better idea of the implementation and was able to fix the errors.

My biggest conceptual error was figuring out the algorithm of when to call what rotate function. I was confident in my height_diff function, but figuring out what exactly to do with that information took some time, particularly when it came to the double rotations.
