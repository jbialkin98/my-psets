I didn't have that much trouble with this pset, but I did have a hard time debugging a little issue. I was using print statements to find where my error was occuring, but I didn't realize that C++ sometimes needed an "endl" after the print statement to correcty print to the terminal. Once I realized this, I could tell what functions were being called, where the program was failing, and how to narrow down the error.

I felt that most of this translated easily from C, so I wasn't too lost. The other issue I had was in running the testing scripts. I got them all to pass after attending office hours, but my code initially produced the correct output whle failing a few of the test cases. I found reading these test cases to be difficult, but some of the ULA's were able to help me identify the functions that were causing the tests to fail, and I could solve it from there.
